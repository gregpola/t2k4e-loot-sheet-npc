# T2K4E Loot Sheet NPC

This module adds an NPC sheet which can be used for loot containers such as chests or corpses in your game. It has a permission system that allows observers to take loot actions which will automatically process the item transaction. 

### History

This version is based from jopeek's module for DND5E (https://github.com/jopeek/fvtt-loot-sheet-npc-5e).

### Features

Allows for easy assembly of items and money to be distributed to players.

More features detailed below.

##### Permissions
Permissions can be set in the sheet for each player and range from no access (cannot open sheet) to observer (view sheet and contents and utilize loot or buy buttons) to owner (view sheet and add/remove items and configure sheet).
